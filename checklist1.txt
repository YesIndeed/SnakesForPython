- Python Lesson 2: FUNctions & Color -
--------------------------------------

Due to the changing seasons and shedding skin, the world of Snake looks greyer than it used to.
Your mission is to figure out how to change colors in our game and to change this boring, grey
world into something awesome.

As you experiment with colors, make sure to answer the questions in this file.

1) What does an RGB triple with low values like (20, 20, 20) look like? What about a triple with high values
   like (240, 240, 240)?

2) As you experiment with changing the color of the snake, keep track of the RGB values
   that you discovered below. There are some colors that you should try to discover.
   There are many ways to represent a color (for example, there are many shades of orange),
   so record at least one RGB value. If you discover some cool colors, add them below!
-- Example: GREY: (60, 60, 60)

RED:
GREEN:
BLUE:
YELLOW:
PURPLE:
CYAN:

3) How can we change the color of a block that already exists (like pieces of the snake)?
   List how you modify the color of an existing block.
